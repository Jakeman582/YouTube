Getting usernames
	Perhaps spend an hour or so collecting channel usernames in a file that can be used for input









Getting a channel's videos along with video statistics

	0. The maximum number of elements per page of response is 50, so we'll use that
		results_per_page = 50

	1. Query the YouTube API to get a channels 'uploads' playlist

		a. Supply a username (Found at the YouTube channel's URL)

		b. service.channels().list(part, forUsername)
			part - String of comma separated parts to get
				contentDetails
				statistics
			forUsername - String with the channel name

		e. The parts of the response:
			items[]->contentDetails->relatedPlaylists->uploads (string)
			items[]->statistics->videoCount (unsigned long)






	2. Query the YouTube API to get the videos in the playlist from part 1
		
		video_count = items[]->statistics->videoCount
		page_count = ceil(video_count / results_per_page)

		a. Supply a playlist ID (found from the previous step)

		b. service.playlistItems().list(part, playlistId, pageToken)
			part - String of comma separated parts to get
				snippet
			playlistId - ID of the playlist
			pageToken - Token specifying which page to get (initially null)

		e. The parts of the response
			items->snippet->resourceId->videoId (string)
			nextPageToken (string)

		l. store the video IDs in memory to use to query for video statistics (comma separated string)





	3. Query the YouTube API to get video details from part 2

		a. Supply the video IDs (from part 2)

		b. service.videos().list(part, ids, pageToken)
			part - String of comma separated parts to get
				snippet
				statistics
			ids - string of comma separated video ids (from part 2)
			pageToken - token supplied by each successive response for next page of results

		c. parts of the response we want
			nextPageToken
			items[]->snippet->title (string, max 100 characters, all valid UTF-8 characters except "<" and ">")
			items[]->statistics->viewCount (unsigned long)
			items[]->statistics->likeCount (unsigned long)
			items[]->statistics->dislikeCount (unsigned long)
			items[]->statistics->commentCount (unsigned long)
